This includes non-shattering plastic used in non-functional decorations. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Each individual piece of non-shattering plastic cannot be larger than 4” x 8” x 0.070”. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><i>Teams</i> must present and display ALL non-shattering plastic parts during inspection. Inspectors will verify the total number of plastic pieces. They may use dry-erase markers or other forms or temporary marking to aid in counting. Inspectors will verify that no non-shattering piece exceeds the size limitation. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Plastic may be mechanically altered by cutting, drilling, bending, etc. It cannot be chemically treated, melted, or cast. Heating polycarbonate to aid in bending is acceptable. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Legal plastic types are polycarbonate (Lexan), acetal monopolymer (Delrin), acetal copolymer (Acetron GP), POM (acetal), ABS, PEEK, PET, HDPE, LDPE, Nylon (all grades), Polypropylene, PTFE, and FEP. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Shattering plastic, such as PMMA (also called Plexiglass, Acrylic, or Perspex), is prohibited. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>Plastic sheets sold by VEX are considered “plastic” in the context of this rule, and are subject to the same limitations as “off-the-shelf” plastic sheets. Examples include the 276-8340 PET sheets, and the 217-6626 / 217-6627 polycarbonate sheets. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>This rule does not apply to 3D printed plastic parts. 3D printed parts are not permitted in the VEX V5 Robotics Competition for any purpose, including non-functional decorations. Note: <i>Teams</i> are strongly encouraged to provide inspectors with 1:1 scale drawings, identical spares, or 1:1 scale tracings of their non-shattering plastic pieces to aid in inspection.

The signal must be given by a <i>Drive Team Member</i> who is standing in the <i>Alliance Station</i>. It is recommended that <i>Drive Team Members</i> also provide verbal notice that they are approaching their <i>Skills Stop Time</i>, such as by counting out “3-2-1-stop.” <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>It is at the <i>Event Partner’s</i> discretion which method will be used to record <i>Skills Stop Times</i> at a given event. The chosen method must be communicated prior to the start of <i>Matches</i> (such as during an event meeting), and made equally available to all <i>Teams</i>. If an event intends to use a manual timekeeping method, a <i>Team</i> may not bring their own V5 Robot Brain just for use during their own <i>Robot Skills Match</i>. If an event intends to utilize a V5 Robot Brain, all <i>Teams</i> must use the same V5 Robot Brain for all <i>Robot Skills Matches</i> on a given <i>Field</i>. If an event is using multiple <i>Fields</i> for <i>Robot Skills Matches</i>, the same method must be used at all <i>Fields</i>, as described in rule &lt;T21&gt;. Multiple V5 Robot Brains may be used as needed (e.g., a “Field 1 Brain” and a “Field 2 Brain”). The default “Drive” program accessed from a V5 Controller is intended for practice only, and may not be used for an official <i>Robot Skills Match</i>. <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>If a <i>Team</i> chooses to utilize/record a <i>Skills Stop Time</i>, the 5-second grace period described in rule &lt;SC1&gt; does not apply. <br><br><strong>Significant Q&amp;As</strong>: <br><strong>•&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"/V5RC/2025-2026/QA/2732\" target=\"_blank\">Q&amp;A 2732</a> - Skills matches can only end early using the process in this rule\n\n",
