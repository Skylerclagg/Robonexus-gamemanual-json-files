If multiple <i>Robot Skills Matches</i> are happening simultaneously on separate <i>Fields</i>, each <i>Field</i> must have its own <i>Scorekeeper Referee</i>. A certified <i>Head Referee</i> must be available at the event to explain a rule, <i>Disqualification</i>, <i>Violation</i>, or other penalty to <i>Teams</i> in <i>Robot Skills Matches</i> as needed in support of the <i>Scorekeeper Referees</i> at skills <i>Fields</i>. <div style=\"background-color: #cecece;font-style: italic;border-radius: 25px; margin: 10px 5px 10px 5px\">Note from the VEX GDC: The rules contained in this Game Manual are written to be enforced by human <i>Head Referees</i>. Many rules have “black-and-white” criteria that can be easily checked. However, some rulings will rely on a judgment call from this human <i>Head Referee</i>. In these cases, <i>Head Referees</i> will make their calls based on what they and the <i>Scorekeeper Referees</i> saw, what guidance is provided by their official support materials (the Game Manual and the Q&amp;A), and most crucially, the context of the <i>Match</i> in question. The VEX IQ Robotics Competition does not have video replay, our <i>Fields</i> do not have absolute sensors to count scores, and most events do not have the resources for an extensive review conference between each <i>Match</i>. When an ambiguous rule results in a controversial call, there is a natural instinct to wonder what the “right” ruling “should have been,” or what the GDC “would have ruled.” This is ultimately an irrelevant question; our answer is that when a rule specifies “<i>Head Referee’s </i>discretion” (or similar), then the “right” call is the one made by the <i>Head Referee</i> in the moment. The VEX GDC designs games, and writes rules, with this expectation (constraint) in mind.</div>\n\n",
