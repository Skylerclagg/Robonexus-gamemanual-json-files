Therefore, {{ITALIC}}Teams{{/ITALIC}} found to be in {{ITALIC}}Violation{{/ITALIC}} of these rules will be held accountable to the strictest interpretations of <G2> and <G4>.

If a {{ITALIC}}Team{{/ITALIC}} is unable, for any reason, to provide reasonable evidence (when requested by event staff) that their {{ITALIC}}Robot{{/ITALIC}} and code are the result of their own work, it is appropriate to assume that the {{ITALIC}}Team{{/ITALIC}} is in violation of <G2> and/or <G4>.

This is not unlike academic honesty concerns in schools, and intellectual property concerns in business. By requiring {{ITALIC}}Students{{/ITALIC}} to defend their designs, we ensure that they are developing not only technical skills, but effective communication skills and accountability, as well.

While it is never our intent to punish {{ITALIC}}Students{{/ITALIC}}, we can legally regulate and restrict the activities of the {{ITALIC}}Teams{{/ITALIC}} in our competitions, and we must preserve the fairness, educational value, and integrity of the competition. Therefore, {{ITALIC}}Teams{{/ITALIC}} found to be in {{ITALIC}}Violation{{/ITALIC}} of these rules will be held accountable to the strictest interpretations of <G2> and <G4>. It is the responsibility of each {{ITALIC}}Team{{/ITALIC}} to be able to explain and defend the design, construction, and programming of their {{ITALIC}}Robot{{/ITALIC}} if questioned by referees, inspectors, {{ITALIC}}Event Partners{{/ITALIC}}, or judges. {{ITALIC}}Teams{{/ITALIC}} should be prepared to describe their design process, justify design decisions, and demonstrate a full understanding of how their {{ITALIC}}Robot{{/ITALIC}} and code function. If a {{ITALIC}}Team{{/ITALIC}} is unable, for any reason, to provide reasonable evidence (when requested by event staff) that their {{ITALIC}}Robot{{/ITALIC}} and code are the result of their own work, it is appropriate to assume that the {{ITALIC}}Team{{/ITALIC}} is in violation of <G2> and/or <G4>. Event organizers cannot reasonably know the origins of every design or independently verify whether a {{ITALIC}}Robot{{/ITALIC}} was created from scratch, purchased online, or copied from pictures of another {{ITALIC}}Team’s{{/ITALIC}} design. When questions of authenticity arise, the only direct and fair approach is to require {{ITALIC}}Students{{/ITALIC}} to explain and defend their work. This is not unlike academic honesty concerns in schools, and intellectual property concerns in business. By requiring {{ITALIC}}Students{{/ITALIC}} to defend their designs, we ensure that they are developing not only technical skills, but effective communication skills and accountability, as well. Consequences may include disqualification from matches, removal from events, and/or escalation of the investigation to VEX Robotics and the RECF for further disciplinary action, which may include sanctions up to and including removal from the program.{{/ITALIC}}\nViolation Notes: \n• {{ITALIC}}Teams{{/ITALIC}} believed to be in {{ITALIC}}Violation{{/ITALIC}} of this rule should be reported to the Judge Advisor, {{ITALIC}}Head Referee{{/ITALIC}}, or {{ITALIC}}Event Partner{{/ITALIC}} for further investigation in coordination with the RSM. Based on the investigation the {{ITALIC}}Team{{/ITALIC}} may be removed from further {{ITALIC}}Matches{{/ITALIC}}, have their Robot Skills Challenge scores removed, and/or be removed from consideration from judged awards. \n• {{ITALIC}}Violations{{/ITALIC}} of this rule will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in tandem with the RECF Student Centered Policy as noted in <G2>, and the REC Foundation Code of Conduct as noted in <G1>. All reported and/or suspected <G4> {{ITALIC}}Violations{{/ITALIC}} should be reported to the {{ITALIC}}Event Partner{{/ITALIC}} during the event, and should be reported to the RECF Rules and Conduct Committee following the event.",
